List out the computational inefficiencies and anti-patterns found in the code block below: 

+ WalletBalance interface is missing blockchain properties
+ Defining the getPriority function inside the component results in the function being recreated every time the 
    component re-renders, which is not necessary.
+ The variable lhsPriority is undefined and the variable balancePriority is created without being used
+ Have not checked balances and prices for valid values ​​before use
+ need to wrap formattedBalances, rows function in useMemo to avoid unnecessary re-rendering
+ formattedBalances function has been created and has not been used. The logic in the rows function is wrong 
    and needs to be corrected because the items in sortedBalances do not have the formatted attribute.
+ className in the rows function is being set incorrectly
